            <time>Dryopithecus</time> This genus lived in Africa,China,India and
            Europe. The genetic title dryopithecus means oak wood apes because
            it is believed that the environmental conditions were such at that
            time with densely forested tropical lowlands and the members might
            have been predominantly herbivorous.

            <time>Ramapithecus</time> The first remains of Ramapithecus were
            discovered from Shivalik hills in Punjab and later discovered in
            Africa and SaudiArabia.The region where Ramapithecines lived was not
            merely forest but open grassland. A hominid status for them is
            claimed on two grounds: Fossil evidence indicating adaptation
            including robust jaws, thickened tooth enamel and shorter canines.
            Extrapolation regarding upright posture and the use of hands for
            food and defense.

            <h2>Australopithecus</h2>
            This genus is the immediate forerunner of the genus Homo.The first
            Australopithecine find was made in 1924 at Taung a limestone quarry
            site in South Africa by Raymond Dart. They walked erect, lived on
            the ground and probably used stones as weapons to hunt small
            animals. They weighed 60 to 90 pounds and were about 4 feet tall.

            <h2>Home Erectus</h2>
            The first evidence of the Homo species was discovered in Java by
            Eugene Dubois in 1891.He named his find as pithecanthropus erectus
            meaning the erect ape man. It is said to be the missing link.
            Another find was made in China ,south-west of Peking called Peking
            man. These had larger cranial capacity then Australopithecus lived
            in communal existence and used fire.

            <time>Homo Sapiens Neanderthalensis</time> The Home erectus
            gradually evolved into the Homo Sapiens. In this transitional event
            two sub-species of the Homo sapiens have been identified. One the
            primitive man who has been labeled Homo sapien Neanderthal and two
            the modern man who is called Homo sapiens sapiens. Most of the
            evidences about the primitive man that have been unearthed are
            75,000 years old. The first fossil that was found of the Neanderthal
            type was a skull cap found in Germany. The cranial capacity of
            Neanderthal exceeded that of the modern man.It ranged from 1200 to
            1610 c.c.

            <time>Homo Sapiens Sapiens</time> The first skeletal remains of Homo
            sapiens sapiens were found in Europe and were named Cro-Magnon. In
            the Homo sapiens sapiens there is final reduction of the jaws, the
            appearance of modern man's chin and of the rounded skull.Mean
            cranial capacity was about 1350 c.c.Modern man is very closely
            related to Cro-magnon.Their culture which dates back to 35,000 years
            is also called upper Paleolithic culture.
